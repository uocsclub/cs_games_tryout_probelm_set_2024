# Challenge 1: Low-Level API Development for Web Services

Task:
Create a TCP web server with extensive functionalities including cross-domain requests, web scraping, REST API integration, and multithreading for optimized performance.

**Restriction:**
All code must be written in C, C++, Rust, or Zig.

**Instructions:**

1. TCP Web Server:
   - Implement a TCP-based web server using C, C++, Rust, or Zig, capable of handling HTTP requests.
   - Ensure robustness and security measures to handle concurrent connections and mitigate common vulnerabilities.

2. Cross-Domain Requests:
   - Enable cross-domain requests to facilitate seamless communication between client and server, adhering to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) standards.

3. Web Scraping:
   - Develop a web scraper to extract data from web pages, utilizing appropriate libraries or frameworks available in the chosen programming language.
   - Design the scraper to handle dynamic content and follow robots.txt guidelines to respect website policies.

4. REST API Integration:
   - Create a RESTful API with endpoints for starting and stopping the web scraping process, accepting input parameters such as the start URL.
   - Implement error handling and validation to ensure data integrity and prevent misuse of API endpoints.

5. Scraping Statistics:
   - Provide functionality to retrieve statistics on the scraping process, including the number of pages explored, queued, and a graphical representation of the page connections.
   - Utilize data visualization techniques to present scraping statistics in an intuitive and informative manner.

6. Multithreading:
   - Implement multithreading to parallelize the web scraping tasks, maximizing throughput and efficiency.
   - Evaluate different multithreading architectures and choose the most suitable design for the given requirements, considering factors like resource utilization and scalability.

**Additional Considerations:**
- Prioritize code readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices in software development.
- Document the implementation details, rationale behind design decisions, and usage instructions for future reference and collaboration.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure the reliability and performance of the web server and associated functionalities across various scenarios and environments.

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Submit the source code along with any necessary instructions or documentation.

**Note:**
Ensure compliance with relevant legal and ethical considerations, including data privacy and intellectual property rights, when conducting web scraping activities.
